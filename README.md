## This repo should explain and list all of my projects. ##
### [Competitive Programming Library](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Samir-99/Competitive-Programming) ###
+ Library I made when I was a student, and still updating it from time to time.
+ Implemented most of the data structure and algorithms I know and used in competitive programming.
+ Implemented data structure from scratch like (AVL tree - Doubly Linked List - Heap - DSU - etc.)
+ Implemented algorithms I'm familiar with like (Dijkstra - Floyd Warshall - Bellman Ford - KMP - Tarjan - etc.)
### [Food Diary](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Samir-99/Projects/tree/master/Food%20Diary) ###
+ Simple application that helps you to keep track of your calories activities.
+ Saw it as an opportunity to implement caching techniques using Redis and learn more about system design and high-level components.
+ Saw it as an opportunity to apply SOLID principles and follow best practices for writing Web APIs.
+ Saw it as an opportunity to learn how to document every component in the system in a clean manner.
+ Developed using Ruby on Rails.
### [Fast Food](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Samir-99/Projects/tree/master/Fast%20Food) ###
+ This project is just to prove that I had some experience even writing a bad thing, there is a much better version of it which can be found [here](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Samir-99/Projects/tree/master/Food%20Diary).
+ A basic restaurant system with some features for generating reports for the manager.
+ I saw this academic project as a chance to learn more about design patterns.
+ Made a very basic visualization for part of the solution.
+ Developed using C# and SQL.
### [Multiple Traveling Salespersons With Drones](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-Samir-99/Projects/tree/master/Multiple%20Traveling%20Salespersons%20With%20Drones) ###
+ Console application that gives an approximated path to deliver packages to customers using drones and vehicles.
+ Saw it as a chance to learn more about Genetic algorithms and Clustering algorithms like (K-Means - hierarchical clustering - KNN)
+ Implemented a fixed approximation heuristic (2-Approximation).
+ Developed it using Python.
### [Basic Static Website](https://github.com/SmallCat3699/Projects/tree/master/Basic%20static%20website#basic-static-website) ###
+ Simple static website I made during my first semester at college.
+ Used only HTML and CSS, but I believe it looks decent.
### [TCP/IP implementation.](https://github.com/SmallCat3699/Projects/tree/master/TCP%20(sorting%20and%20searching)#simple-console-apllication-which-has-2-sides-server-and-client) ###
+ Simple console application which consists of two entities (server - client) using TCP/IP protocol.
+ Client-side:
    + should send an array of items to the server.
    + ask the server to do one of the following using multi-threading:
        + Sort the array using (Merge - Quick - Count) sort.
        + Search the array for a specific value using (Binary - Sequential) search.
+ Server-side:
    + Receiving the array from the client-side.
    + Executing the desired operation.
    + Returning the result to the client-side.
