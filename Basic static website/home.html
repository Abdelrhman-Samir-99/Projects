<div class="subsect subsectOne"><p alig="center">Working online involves a distinct set of ethical challenges some similar to working face to face and others unique to this way of communicating with clients at a distance from you. In all cases the established values, principles and personal moral qualities provide useful points of reference for thinking through the issues involved. The Ethical Framework for the Counselling Professions , states that: We will fulfil the ethical principles and values set out in this Ethical Framework regardless of whether working online, face to face or using any other methods of communication. The technical and practical knowledge may vary according to how services are delivered but all our services will be delivered to at least fundamental professional standards or better (Good Practice, Point 20).</p>
<p>Working online is used in this guidance to include all methods of communication using digital and information technology regardless of whether equipment used is a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone or any other device. "Working online" is also sometimes referred to as "working at a distance" to establish a distinction from working in the physical presence of the other person. The main focus of this guidance is exploring some of the key issues involved in meeting the ethics and standards for working online, with particular regard to services for clients or closely related activities. </p></div>
